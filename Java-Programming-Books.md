# 英文原文
Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Meanwhile, others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).

The latest versions are Java 13, released in September 2019, and Java 11, a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version, released on September 25, 2018; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use, while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020. Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues. Since Java 9 (and 10 and 12) is no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version (currently Java 13) or an LTS release.

Java 是通用型编程语言，它是基于类的、面向对象和设计有很少依赖项的。它试图让应用开发者编写一次代码，运行在任何地方，意味着编译的Java代码能够运行在java支持的所有平台上而不需要重新编译。Java应用通常会编译成字节码运行在Java虚拟机上，而不是底层的计算机架构。Java的语法跟C/C++很类似，但是机器底层的细节要比后者少很多。在2019年，Java是Github上使用的最受欢迎的一种编程语言，特别是客户端-服务端架构的Web应用，根据报告有着9百万开发者在使用。   

Java是由 James Gosling 在Sun Microsystems公司（后来给Oracle公司收购了）任职过程中开发创造的，并且在1995年发布了Java平台的核心组件。最初实现了Java编译器、虚拟机和类库，发布在Sun许可证之下。在2007年5月，遵从Java社区的规格，Sun公司重新发布了Java 技术许可证在GPL开源许可证之下。与此同时，其他开发的替代Sun公司技术的实现，像Java GUN编译器、GUN Classpath（标准库）和IceTea-Web（浏览器插件）。

Java的最新版本是Java 13，发行于2019年9月，还有发布于 2018年9月25日的长期支持版本 Java 11 LTS。Oracle 发行的Java8 LTS，最后免费商业使用的截止日期为 2019年1月，Java8的个人使用更新截止日期是2020年12月。Oracle非常建议卸载旧版本的Java，因为他们有严重的漏洞和安全问题。从Java9（到10和12）不在有长周期支持版本了，Oracle 建议用户立即更新到最新的版本（当前Java13）或者长周期发行版。
